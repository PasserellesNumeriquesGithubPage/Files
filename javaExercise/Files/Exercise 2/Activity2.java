// Continue with the activity from Monday. Use the same repository.

// 1. Create a class with at least 2 properties, and also your own Exception class.
// 2. In the Main Class, there will be a number input that will ask the user how many objects to create.
// 3. Put the objects inside an array of objects created, you can use ArrayList and use the class that you created as the object.
// 4. Ask for user input for the values of the properties (ex. Name, Age for Person class). All the objects created must have values.
// 5. Think of two scenarios to prevent and implement  try catch. (ex. Name should be string or should not contain special characters etc.)

// You can create or use the Main class used from Monday. Submit with the repository link.
